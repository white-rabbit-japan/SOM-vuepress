# 7.6 REINFORCEMENT AND REWARD

One thing is sure: we always find it easier to do things we've done before. What happens in our minds to make that possible? Here's one idea: In the course of solving some problem, certain agents must have aroused certain other agents. So let's take "reward" to mean that if agent A has been involved in arousing agent B, the effect of reward is, somehow, to make it easier for A to arouse B in the future and also, perhaps, to make it harder for A to arouse other agents. At one time, I was so taken with this idea that I designed a machine called the Snarc, which learned according to this principle; it was composed of forty agents, each connected to several others, more or less at random, through a "reward" system that, when activated after each success, made each agent more likely to rearouse the same recipients at later times.

We presented this machine with problems like learning to find a path through a maze while avoiding a hostile predator. It quickly learned to solve easy problems but never could learn to solve hard problems like building towers or playing chess. It became clear that, in order to solve complicated problems, any machine of limited size must be able to reuse its agents in different ways in different contexts &mdash; as See must do when involved in two concurrent tasks. But when the Snarc tried to learn its way through a complicated maze, a typical agent might suggest a good direction to move in at one moment, then suggest a bad direction at another moment. Later, when we rewarded it for doing something we liked, both those decisions became more likely &mdash; and all those "goods" and "bads" tended to cancel one another out!

This poses a dilemma in designing machines that learn by "reinforcing" the connections between agents. In the course of solving a hard problem, one will usually try several bad moves before finding a good one &mdash; for this is virtually what we mean by calling a problem "hard." To avoid learning those bad moves, we could design a machine to reinforce only what happened in the last few moments before success. But such a machine would be able to learn only to solve problems whose solutions require just a few steps. Alternatively, we could design the reward to work over longer spans of time; however, that would not only reward the bad decisions along with the good but would also erase other things that it had previously learned to do. We cannot learn to solve hard problems by indiscriminately reinforcing agents or their connections. Why is it that among all the animals, only the great-brained relatives of man can learn to solve problems that require many steps or involve using the same agencies for different purposes? We'll seek the answer in the policies our agencies use for accomplishing goals.

You might argue that a beaver goes through many steps to build a dam, as does a colony of termites when it builds its complex castle nest. However, these wonderful animals do not learn such accomplishments as individuals but use the procedures that have become encoded in their species' genes over millions of years of evolution. You cannot train a beaver to build a termite nest or teach termites to build beaver dams.
