# 13 SEEING AND BELIEVING

> _Our puppet strings are hard to see,   
So we perceive ourselves as free,  
Convinced that no mere objects could  
Behave in terms of bad and good._

> _To you, we mannikins seem less than live,  
because our consciousness is that of dummies,  
made to sit on laps of gods and mouth their wit;  
Are you, our transcendental gods,  
likewise dangled from your rods,  
and need, to show spontaneous charm,  
some higher god’s inserted arm?_

> _We seem to form a nested set,  
with each the next one’s marionette,
who, if you asked him, would insist
that he’s the last ventriloquist._

&mdash;Theodore Melnechuk
