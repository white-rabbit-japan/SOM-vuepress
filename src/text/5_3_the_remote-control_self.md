# 5.3 THE REMOTE-CONTROL SELF

When people have no answers to important questions, they often give some anyway.

- _What controls the brain? The Mind._
- _What controls the mind? The Self._
- _What controls the Self? Itself._

To help us think about how our minds are connected to the outer world, our culture teaches schemes like this:

This diagram depicts our sensory machinery as sending information to the brain, wherein it is projected on some inner mental movie screen. Then, inside that ghostly theater, a lurking Self observes the scene and then considers what to do. Finally, that Self may act &mdash; somehow reversing all those steps &mdash; to influence the real world by sending various signals back through yet another family of remote-control accessories.

This concept simply doesn't work. It cannot help for you to think that inside yourself lies someone else who does your work. This notion of "homunculus" &mdash; a little person inside each self &mdash; leads only to a paradox since, then, that inner Self requires yet another movie screen inside itself, on which to project what it has seen! And then, to watch that play-within-a-play, we'd need yet another Self-inside-a-Self &mdash; to do the thinking for the last. And then this would all repeat again, as each new Self requires yet another one to do its job!

- _The idea of a single, central Self doesn't explain anything. This is because a thing with no parts provides nothing that we can use as pieces of explanation!_

Then why do we so often embrace the strange idea that what we do is done by Someone Else &mdash; that is, our Self? Because so much of what our minds do is hidden from the parts of us that are involved with consciousness.
