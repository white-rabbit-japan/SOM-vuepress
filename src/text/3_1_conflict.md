# 3.1 CONFLICT

Most children not only like to build, they also like to knock things down. So let's imagine another agent called _Wrecker_, whose specialty is knocking-down. Our child loves to hear the complicated noises and watch so many things move all at once.

Suppose _Wrecker_ gets aroused, but there's nothing in sight to smash. Then _Wrecker_ will have to get some help &mdash; by putting _Builder_ to work, for example. But what if, at some later time, _Wrecker_ considers the tower to be high enough to smash, while _Builder_ wants to make it taller still? Who could settle that dispute?

The simplest policy would be to leave that decision to Wrecker, who was responsible for activating _Builder_ in the first place. But in a more realistic picture of a child's mind, such choices would depend on many other agencies. For example, let's assume that both _Builder_ and _Wrecker_ were originally activated by a higher-level agent, _Play-with-Blocks_. Then, a conflict might arise if Builder and Wrecker disagree about whether the tower is high enough.

What aroused _Play-with-Blocks_ in the first place? Perhaps some even higher-level agent, Play, was active first. Then, inside _Play_, the agent _Play-with-Blocks_ achieved control, in spite of two competitors, _Play-with-Dolls_ and Play-with-Animals. But even Play itself, their mutual superior-in-chief, must have had to compete with other higher-level agencies like _Eat_ and _Sleep_. For, after all, a child's play is not an isolated thing but always happens in the context of other real-life concerns. Whatever we may choose to do, there are always other things we'd also like to do.

In several sections of this book, I will assume that conflicts between agents tend to migrate upward to higher levels. For example, any prolonged conflict between _Builder_ and _Wrecker_ will tend to weaken their mutual superior, _Play-with-Blocks_. In turn, this will reduce _Play-with-Blocks'_ ability to suppress its rivals, _Play-with-Dolls_ and _Play-with-Animals_. Next, if that conflict isn't settled soon, it will weaken the agent _Play_ at the next-higher level. Then _Eat_ or _Sleep_ might seize control.
