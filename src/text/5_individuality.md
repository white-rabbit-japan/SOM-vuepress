# Chapter 5 INDIVIDUALITY

## PUNCH AND JUDY TO THEIR AUDIENCE

_Our puppets strings are hard to see,  
So we perceive ourselves as free,  
Convinced that no mere objects could  
Behave in terms of bad and good._
 
_To you, we mannequins seem less  
than live, because our consciousness    
is that of dummies, made to sit  
on laps of gods and mouth their wit;_

_Are you, our transcendental gods,  
likewise dangled from your rods,  
and need, to show spontaneous charm,  
some higher god's inserted arm?_

_We seem to form a nested set,  
With each the next one's marionette,  
Who, if you asked him, would insist,  
that he's the last ventriloquist._

&mdash;Theodore Melnechuk
