# Prologue

I first read _The Society of Mind_ at age 15. I first emailed Minsky a few years later&mdash;pre-world-wide-web&mdash; while working in manufacturing and process improvement at Compaq Computer Corporation at age 18. My message pitched a Media Lab <> Compaq collaboration, which led to Compaq's involvement in the 'Future Workplace' project, a Media Lab initiative with the aim of eliminating the keyboard from the workplace. Thrilled to have opened correponsdance with Minsky, I proceeded to nag him about writing another book, to which he replied "soon!"

I started engaging with the other AI-enthusiasts online, and was thrilled when he chimed in on a debate I'd engaged in with someone

More than a decade later, in 2003 he started sending me drafts of "The Emotion Machine." At the time I had just started a small publishing business in Japan and hardly had time to read those texts.

2017
Just had a wonderful telephone conversation with Gloria Rudisch, wife of the late Marvin Minsky. At 90-years-old she's been practicing pediatrics for 68 years, and her mind is sharper than most people half her age.
